The easiest start is with docker:(adjust the docker-compose.yml file for domainnnames, usernames and passwords)

in the docker directory:
docker-compose -p moqui up -d

will create all instances required, taking the images from hub.docker.com

to run locally:
git clone https://github.com/growerp/moqui-framework.git moqui && cd moqui
git clone https://github.com/growerp/moqui-runtime runtime
git clone https://github.com/growerp/growerp-moqui.git runtime/component/growerp
git clone https://github.com/growerp/PopCommerce.git runtime/component/PopCommerce

git clone https://github.com/growerp/moqui-fop.git runtime/component/moqui-fop
./gradlew build
java -jar moqui.war load types=seed,seed-initial,install
